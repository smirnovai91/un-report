## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, include=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r packages, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


This report is created for UN. Testing associations between GDP and CO2 emissions.


```{r loading data}
#setwd("C:/Users/innas/Desktop/un-report")
gapminder_1997 <- read_csv("Desktop/un-report/data/gapminder_1997.csv")

```

```{r gdp_lifeexp_1997, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder_1997) +
  aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, color=continent, size=pop/1000000) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x="GDP per capita",
       y="Life expectancy",
       title="Do people in wealthy countries live longer?",
       size="Population in millions")

```
```{r}
nCountries <- gapminder_1997 %>% 
  select(country) %>% 
  n_distinct()

minGDP <- gapminder_1997 %>% 
  summarise(round(min(gdpPercap))) %>% 
  pull() # extracts column

maxGDP <- gapminder_1997 %>% 
  summarise(round(max(gdpPercap))) %>% 
  pull() # extracts column

```

The above plot shows the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy for a total of `r nCountries` countries. For this set, economic wealth ranged from a minimum of `r minGDP` USD to a maximum of
`r maxGDP` USD per capita.


|Summary of Data|
|--------|--------|
|Number of countries|`r nCountries`|
|Minimum GDP per capita|`r minGDP`|
|Maximum GDP per capita|`r maxGDP`|

```{r kabletable}
library(knitr)

gapminder_1997 %>% 
  filter(continent=="Oceania") %>% 
  kable()

Exercise: R Markdown Syntax
* create a bullet point list with 3 items
* 1st item=name of your fav programming language in bold
* 2nd item=most useful function in italics
* 3rd item=learning goal in bold italics
* turn your bullet point list into a numbered list
* create a 4th list item=markdown help list name and hyperlink


* My bullet point list "My programming journey"
    + My favorite programming language is **Python** 
    + Most useful Python function I learnt was *pickle*
    + My learning goal is to **_practice more and more Python:)_**
    
My list:

* **R**
* _mutate()_
* ***regression analysis in Python***


```{toggle my comments, include=FALSE}

*word* OR _word_ creates "italics" font
**word** creates bold font

\newline creates blank line in the output doc

```
